# mastering-algorithms
Code developed while working through Sedgewick's [Algorithm, 4th ed](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/). The project here is related to, but not specifically targeted to, [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and [Algorithms, Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2). That is, this is more a deep dive into the text, not solutions to the Coursera course, though there might be some overlap. 

**N.B.**: Cut-n-Paste beware: As this isn't specifically for the coursera course, I don't intend to worry about limiting the structure, library and language features to those allowed / required by the Coursera course checker. If you submit anything from here, it may not be accepted. While I intend to limit 3rdparty libraries to [Algorthims Course Libraries](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4), I reserve the right to use other FOSS where it makes sense, and I certainly am likely to package the developed code in checker incompatible ways.

I intend to use the visualization code and the libraries extensively, and to work out interesting (to me) exercises.

# Version
At this time, this is 0.0.0 (pre-alpha). There is little to no code related to the ultimate purpose.

# Initial (overhead) steps  
* Import into Spring Tool Suite (Modded Eclipse IDE that I use at work)
* Fix packages / source layout

# Dependecies / Requirements
* Gradle
* Java 8
* JUnit 4
* See TODO for Future Deps
  
# TODO
* Add external libraries and update Gradle
  *[Algorithms Course Libraries](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4)
* Add data files [Data for Text](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4-data.zip)
